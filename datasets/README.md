# Data Preparing
 we conducted experiments using publicly available datasets FUMPE and CAD-PE . We only selected fixed-angle PE images and corresponding labels for each case. By the way, the dataset code "dataset_synapse.py" we are used is provided by the authors of [TransUNet](https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet).
